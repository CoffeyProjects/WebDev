                <h2>Eastman Georgia</h2>
                <p class="cardtext">Hello everyone,<br><br>Today, it is my greatest pleassure to announce that this year the city of Eastman will be hosting the annual Float or Airshow Event this year! We would love it if everyone would join us for this occasion of family fun, cool air vehicles, great food, and more! As your mayor, I speak with great pride as I have been working closely with the Eastman Police Department, Eastman Fire Department, and the Dooley County Sheriff's Office months in advance to make sure everything would be in place and ensure that all areas of togetherness would be at their safest. There will be hot air balloons, all kinds of food from various ethnic backgrounds, and there will be street performers! You can also give your kids the thrill of being sky high by letting them ride on one of the hot air balloons. And did I mension there would be helicopters? Well, you know what that means, don't you? Indeed, helicopter rides! There will also be other activities like carnival games! Of course, we can't forget that this will be a two-day event from 7am to 8pm for both days the event goes on. With that said, I'd like the bring attention to the other man eye catcher which would be the airshow, of course! Come witness all kinds of jets and planes strut their stuff all over the sky above your head! These are highly trained pilots who have been flying planes of all kinds with years of experience. Have you ever wanted to see two air buses doing flight tricks? Come on down to the event! There will be air shows going on all day! Kids also get a free remote control plane or helicopter. But I must ask that you all let the professionals handle all the flying until you get home. We wouldn't want someone crashing their remote controlled vehicles into a real flight vehicale and getting destroyed, would we? Furthermore, I would to ensure everyone that your safety is paramount to use, so, I would appreciate it if parents would keep a close eye on their children and please report any suspicious activity to any officer you see. If anyone feels bad or sick in any way, please go see the medical staff as soon as possible to get checked out. I hope everyone has an amazing time.<br><br> - Mayor J.B. Johnson</p>
